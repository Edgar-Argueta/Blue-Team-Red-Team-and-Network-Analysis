# Blue-Team-Red-Team-and-Network-Analysis

The purpose of this project was to practice the variety of skills and programs learned throughout the bootcamp course. I took on the role as a pen tester and a SOC analyst.  During the project, these were the main objectives:

•	Create alerts and thresholds using the Watcher feature in Kibana.

•	Find flags through vulnerabilities/exploits to gain access to the Wordpress site and server.

•	Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic.

•	Create a presentation highlighting either the Red team, Blue team, or Network Analysis aspect. The presentation had to include an assessment, analysis, and hardening methods of the system.

Reports were created for the [Red Team](https://github.com/Edgar-Argueta/Blue-Team-Red-Team-and-Network-Analysis/blob/0994c278aed0d4a663eaaf6fa6be5a03c424b1ed/Red%20Team_%20Summary%20of%20Operations.md), the [Blue Team](https://github.com/Edgar-Argueta/Blue-Team-Red-Team-and-Network-Analysis/blob/0994c278aed0d4a663eaaf6fa6be5a03c424b1ed/Blue%20Team_%20Summary%20of%20Operations.md), and the [Network Analysis](https://github.com/Edgar-Argueta/Blue-Team-Red-Team-and-Network-Analysis/blob/0994c278aed0d4a663eaaf6fa6be5a03c424b1ed/Network%20Analysis_%20Summary%20of%20Operations.md), which were used to create an in-depth analysis presentation.
